    <h2>Chorizo Queso Potato Bombs</h2>
    <p>Try these chorizo queso potato bombs if you feel like trying out something new. The perfect appetizer, they are 
        crunchy on the outside and rich and creamy on the inside.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 medium potatoes (2 to 3 inch long)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 lbcooked, ground chorizo sausage</li>
        <li>1/2 cup prepeared queso dip</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup plain breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><p><em>Step 1</em></p>
            <p>Place potatoes and salt in a medium saucepan and add water to cover by one inch.  Place pot over high heat and bring to a boil.  Cook until just tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Potatoes should not be soft. 
            Drain and set aside until cool enough to handle. </p>
        </li>
        <li><p><em>step 2</em></p>
        <p>Slice potatoes in half across the center and scoop out the center flesh carefully, leaving a 1/8 of an inch border of flesh. Combine 
            sausage and queso in a medium bowl and stir until cream</p>
        </li>
        <li><p><em>Step 3</em></p>
        <p>Place about 1 teaspoon chorizo mixture in one potato half and place 1 to 2 teaspoons of shredded cheese in the corresponding potato half. Press the two halves together allowing the starch from the potato to hold together as best as possible. Coat each potato in egg, allowing excess to
            drip, and lightly coat in breadcrumbs, taking care not to allow the potato
            halves to separate.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p><em>Step 4</em></p>
            <p>Preheat an airfryer to to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). 
                Spray potatoes lightly with oil or cooking spray.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p><em>Step 5</em></p>
        <p>Air fry in batches if necessary until golden and crispy,
             8 to 10 minutes. Let stand for 5 minutes before serving.</p></li>
    </ol>
